## ldap injection
LDAP injection is an attack that exploits web applications that use LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) for authentication or storing user information. The attacker can inject malicious code or characters into LDAP queries to alter the application's behaviour, bypass security measures, and access sensitive data stored in the LDAP directory.  
To test for LDAP injection, you can use input values that contain special characters or operators that can change the query's meaning:  
<pre>
Input	  Description
*	      An asterisk * can match any number of characters.
( )	    Parentheses ( ) can group expressions.
|	      A vertical bar | can perform logical OR.
&	      An ampersand & can perform logical AND.
(cn=*)	Input values that try to bypass authentication or authorisation checks by injecting conditions that always evaluate to true can be used. For example, (cn=*) or (objectClass=*) can be used as input values for a username or password fields.
