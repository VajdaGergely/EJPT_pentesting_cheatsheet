# gitlab
## info
GitLab is a web-based Git-repository hosting tool that provides wiki capabilities, issue tracking, and continuous integration and deployment pipeline functionality.  
GitLab is similar to GitHub and BitBucket, which are also web-based Git repository tools.  
During internal and external penetration tests, it is common to come across interesting data in a company's GitHub repo or a self-hosted GitLab or BitBucket instance. These Git repositories may just hold publicly available code such as scripts to interact with an API. However, we may also find scripts or configuration files that were accidentally committed containing cleartext secrets such as passwords that we may use to our advantage.  
Applications such as GitLab allow for public repositories (that require no authentication), internal repositories (available to authenticated users), and private repositories (restricted to specific users).  
## discovery and enumeration
We can quickly determine that GitLab is in use in an environment by just browsing to the GitLab URL, and we will be directed to the login page, which displays the GitLab logo.  
The only way to footprint the GitLab version number in use is by browsing to the /help page when logged in.  
If the GitLab instance allows us to register an account, we can log in and browse to this page to confirm the version.  
If we cannot register an account, we may have to try a low-risk exploit such as this: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49821  
We do not recommend launching various exploits at an application, so if we have no way to enumerate the version number (such as a date on the page, the first public commit, or by registering a user), then we should stick to hunting for secrets and not try multiple exploits against it blindly.
