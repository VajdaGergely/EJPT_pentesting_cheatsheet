# splunk
## info
Splunk does not suffer from many exploitable vulnerabilities  
The biggest focus of Splunk during an assessment would be weak or null authentication  
Admin access to Splunk gives us the ability to deploy custom applications that can be used to quickly compromise a Splunk server  
Often runs as root on Linux or SYSTEM on Windows systems in internal networks.  
While uncommon, we may encounter Splunk externally facing at times.  
The Splunk Enterprise trial converts to a free version after 60 days, which doesnâ€™t require authentication.  
It is not uncommon for system administrators to install a trial of Splunk to test it out, which is subsequently forgotten about.  
## default port
The Splunk web server runs by default on port 8000.  
Port 8089, the Splunk management port for communication with the Splunk REST API.  
## default credentials
On older versions of Splunk, the default credentials are admin:changeme  
The latest version of Splunk sets credentials during the installation process.  
If the default credentials do not work, it is worth checking for common weak passwords such as admin, Welcome, Welcome1, Password123, etc.
