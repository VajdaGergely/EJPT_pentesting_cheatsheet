# Cold Fusion
## info
ColdFusion is a programming language and a web application development platform based on Java.  
ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) is the proprietary programming language used in ColdFusion to develop dynamic web applications. It has a syntax similar to HTML, making it easy to learn for web developers. CFML includes tags and functions for database integration, web services, email management, and other common web development tasks.  
Thanks to its built-in functions and features, CFML enables developers to create complex business logic using minimal code. Moreover, ColdFusion supports other programming languages, such as JavaScript and Java, allowing developers to use their preferred programming language within the ColdFusion environment.

## enumeration (identifing ColdFusion)
* nmap scanning
* file extensions (.cfm, .cfc)
* HTTP response headers ("Server: ColdFusion" or "X-Powered-By: ColdFusion")
* error messages
* default files ("admin.cfm" or "CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm")

on port 8500 maybe path traversal is enabled  
should do look around the files that are hosted
