## Dumping creds from LSASS with mimikatz
* LSASS is important for us because it caches NTLM hashes and other credentials, which we can extract using the sekurlsa Mimikatz module. We need to understand that **LSASS runs under the SYSTEM user and is therefore even more privileged than a process started as Administrator**.
* Due to this, **we can only extract passwords if we are running Mimikatz as Administrator (or higher) and have the SeDebugPrivilege access right enabled**. This access right grants us the ability to debug not only processes we own, but also all other users’ processes.
* **We can also elevate our privileges to the SYSTEM account with tools like PsExec or the built-in Mimikatz token elevation function to obtain the required privileges**. The token elevation function requires the SeImpersonatePrivilege access right to work, but all local administrators have it by default.
