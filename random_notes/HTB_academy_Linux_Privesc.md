# Hack The Box academy Linux Privilege Escalation notes
## intro
### short
* basic things to check
  * OS version, kernel version, running services
* basic commands
  * ps aux | grep root (root processes)
  * ps au (similar than ps aux)
  * ls -la /, ls -la /home, ls -la /home/user1, ls -la /home/user1/.ssh
  * history, sudo -l, crontab -l, cat /etc/*cron*, ls -la /etc/*cron*
  * cat /etc/passwd, cat /etc/shadow
### detailed
* OS Version: Knowing the distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, FreeBSD, Fedora, SUSE, Red Hat, CentOS, etc.) will give you an idea of the types of tools that may be available. This would also identify the operating system version, for which there may be public exploits available.
* Kernel Version: As with the OS version, there may be public exploits that target a vulnerability in a specific kernel version. Kernel exploits can cause system instability or even a complete crash. Be careful running these against any production system, and make sure you fully understand the exploit and possible ramifications before running one.
* Running Services: Knowing what services are running on the host is important, especially those running as root. A misconfigured or vulnerable service running as root can be an easy win for privilege escalation. Flaws have been discovered in many common services such as Nagios, Exim, Samba, ProFTPd, etc. Public exploit PoCs exist for many of them, such as CVE-2016-9566, a local privilege escalation flaw in Nagios Core < 4.2.4.
