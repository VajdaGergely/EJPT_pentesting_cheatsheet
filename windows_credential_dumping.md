# win credential dumping
# important info
Dumping hashes on Windows is need elevated privileges (admin privileges) !!!!!!
## windows password hashes
* location
  * SAM (Security Accounts Manager) database
* auth and verify creds
  * LSA (Local Security Authority)
* hash types
  * Windows Server 2003 (and before)
    * LM, NTLM
  * Windows Vista (and later)
    * just NTLM hash (or NT hash)
* NTLM versions
  * NTLMv1
  * NTLMv2
* SAM
  * SAM database file can not be copied while OS is running
  * thats why we usually dump it from in-memory places (like LSASS)
  * in modern versions of windows, SAM database is encrypted with a syskey
  * admin priv needed to intercat with LSASS process
